I am trying to make a habit of writing sort challenging program in my extra time.
It helps me explore new ways to do the same problem. Also keeps me on point on 
syntax. Following are the files and its sort description of what it does.

#Files 

[1] rev.java
It has three functions:

	[a] Function to reverse the integer from user input.
		eg: 

	    	input = 1234
	    	output = 4321

	[b] Function to reverse the string from user input. 
		eg: 

	   	 input = abcd
	   	 output = dcba

	[c] Function to find the reverse factorial from user input.
		eg: 

	    	input = 5040
	    	output = 7!

[2] uniqueChar.java
	this program return unique char from user input.
	eg:

	     input = "aanngghhb"
             output = "b"

[3] AnnaGram.java
	This programs takes in two different strings from user and checks if they 
	are annagram of each other.
	eg: 

	    input1 = "what"
	    input2 = "twah"
	    output = above string are anagram 

	    input1 = "what for"
	    input2 = "for that"
	    output = above strings are not annagram

[4] closeToZero.java
	This program returns the number closer to zero.
	eg:
	
	    input = {98, 34, 27, 8, 0.99, -87, 9}
            output = 0.99
