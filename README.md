I am trying to make a habit of writing sort challenging program in my extra time.
It helps me explore new ways to do the same problem. Also keeps me on point on 
syntax. Following are the files and its sort description of what it does.

#Files 

rev.java
It has three functions:
[1] Function to reverse the integer from user input.
	eg: input = 1234
	    output = 4321

[2] Function to reverse the string from user input. 
	eg: input = abcd
	    output = dcba

[3] Function to find the reverse factorial from user input.
	eg: input = 5040
	    output = 7!
